            I am a Software/Web Developer based in Sonora, MÃ©xico. At the
            beginning of my journey, I mainly focused on desktop apps and
            back-end, but have since branched out to designing and building
            full-stack web/mobile apps.
            <br />I am passionate about learning, and I believe there is no
            better way to do it than through practice.

            I have mainly worked on personal and school projects built on
            Angular, Flutter, React, and Java, while also exploring languages
            such as C# and Visual Basic.
            <br />
            Regarding database engines, I've worked with MySQL, SQL Server,
            PostgreSQL, Firebase RTDB, Firebase Firestore, and MongoDB.
