# saulprl React portfolio

After learning **React** during Summer '22, I decided to renew my current portfolio which is built on Flutter.

As of the start of this project, my idea is to build a **Material UI** (with which I've worked before) version alongside a **Chakra UI** one, in order to explore a new library and I'll use whichever I'm more satisfied with. In order to achieve this, I'll be working on two different branches.
