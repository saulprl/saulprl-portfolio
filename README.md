# saulprl React portfolio

After learning **React** during Summer '22, I decided to renew my current portfolio which is built on Flutter.

As of the start of this project, my idea is to build a **Material UI** (which I've worked with before) version alongside a **Chakra UI** one, in order to explore a new library and I'll use whichever I'm more satisfied with. In order to achieve this, I'll be working on two different branches.

## Update Dec 12 2022

After starting with this project, I encountered some issues with VS Code autocompletion for Chakra UI (was forced to manually import components which is really inefficient). Because of this, I decided to just use Material UI and I'll again in the future with Chakra.

This project is now being hosted on GitHub Pages, you can check it out by clicking [here](https://saulprl.github.io/saulprl-portfolio).

# What I learned

- Differences between HashRouter and BrowserRouter: since GH Pages doesn't really support SPAs, I had to look up workarounds and eventually landed on HashRouter. Because of this, I also learned about Next.js and I might start learning it!
- During this project I finally found some usage for `git stash` while I was testing different optimization techniques.
- Lazy loading and React Suspense.
- cwebp tool.
- React Profiler.
- React TransitionGroup.
- CSS Animations and Transitions.
